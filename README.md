### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on some projects that contain private data, so they are not displayed here (including translation code from different languages to English, tokenization, fuzzy matching for Indicators text, among others).
- ðŸŒ± The business needs I have come across have led me to be increasingly interested in NLP. Especially its applications to deriving value from open text (such as deriving insights from comments), performing similarity comparison of Indicators definitions, translating datasets from different languages to other languages, etc.
- I am also interested in evaluating program effectiveness through causal inference methods, especially related to Economic Development, tackling root causes of poverty. I especially care about children from all nations, and want to contribute so that they can flourish.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: dsuzuki@g.clemson.edu
