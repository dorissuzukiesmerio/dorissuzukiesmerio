### Welcome to my GitHub

My name is Doris Suzuki Esmerio, I work as a Data Scientist in an organization that seeks to promote Economic Development in communities across the world (Africa, Asia, South and Central America, Eastern Europe, Oceania).

- My work contributes to Monitoring and Evaluation, Research and Learning and Strategy Realization Office. I am particularly interested in evaluating program effectiveness through causal inference methods (Impact Evaluations). I especially care about children from all nations, and want to contribute so that they can flourish.
- I'm constantly developing skills related to the data pipeline / data flow / data architecture, automation of processes, and advanced data cleaning. 
  
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on some projects that contain private data, so they are not displayed here (including translation code from different languages to English, tokenization, fuzzy matching for Indicators text, among others).
- ðŸŒ± The business needs I have come across have led me to be increasingly interested in NLP. Especially its applications to deriving value from open text (such as deriving insights from comments), performing similarity comparison of Indicators definitions, translating datasets from different languages to other languages, etc.
