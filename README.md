**dorissuzukiesmerio/dorissuzukiesmerio** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.


- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on some projects that contain private data, so they are not displayed here (including translation code from different languages to English, tokenization, fuzzy matching for Indicators text, among others).
- ğŸŒ± I have a special interest in NLP, deriving insights from comments, and also evaluating program effectiveness through causal inference methods.
