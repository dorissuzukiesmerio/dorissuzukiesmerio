### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on some projects that contain private data, so they are not displayed here (including translation code from different languages to English, tokenization, fuzzy matching for Indicators text, among others).
- ðŸŒ± The business needs I have come across have led me to be increasingly interested in NLP and its applications to open text (deriving insights from comments), automating mapping of information.
- I am also interested in evaluating program effectiveness through causal inference methods.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: dsuzuki@g.clemson.edu
